#The Point of this Project:
Implements Okapi BM25, herein called the bm25ranking function. 

#The Design:
This function computes a BM25 document-term matrix, and stores this matrix as an array of arrays. Function's main parameter is a text document collection in the form of an array of strings--each text document here is a string.
